django-livinglots-mailings
==========================

Part of 596 Acres' 速 `Living Lots <https://github.com/596acres/django-livinglots>`_ 速,
a Django app that sends emails based on simple criteria.

This app is currently mostly used to email participants after a certain amount
of time that they have been active on the site. Living Lots also sends
notifications to site facilitators and managers via `django-livinglots-notify
<https://github.com/596acres/django-livinglots-notify>`_ and to participants
through `django-livinglots-organize
<https://github.com/596acres/django-livinglots-organize>`_.

This app could easily be extended to send more email in response to more 
complex conditions. See `models.py` and `mailers.py`.

This module is part of the `Living Lots <https://github.com/596acres/django-livinglots>`_ 速 framework by `596 Acres
<https://596acres.org>`_ 速.
